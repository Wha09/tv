<font color="#000000"> <p> Chip is a talented skateboarder seeking to make it big in the sport.
He has mastered skills such as (just a few examples):
    <UL>
    <LI> Kickflip </LI>
    <LI> Fakie </LI>
    <LI> Manual </LI>
    <LI> Kickturn </LI> </UL>
<H4> <U> He even expressed his love of this sport in a little rhyme! </U> </H4>
When I go roll, roll, rolling on my skateboard,
<br> I feel the wind blow, blow, blowing on my face.
<br> My body glides, glides, glides along in the freedom,
<br> Then my foot keeps, keeps, keeps up with the pace.
<br> Riding is my joy, I can <I> nut </I> lie,
<br> <I>Nut</I>-thing compares to the high I get, skating under the big blue sky
<br> I'll do a kickflip then grind on the rail, it makes me feel like I can fly
<br> And if I feel a little off, I'll do a quick bail
<br> But everything's all good when I look around and see the nature of TeddyVale
<br> Cuz these wheels are my escape and they're more than just what people see
<br> The skateboard becomes more, more, more than just my friend, it's like family
